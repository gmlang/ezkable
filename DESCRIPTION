Description: It is difficult to show a large table properly in a pdf document
        produced by R markdown. This package solves that problem by combining 
        functions from the kableExtra and knitr packages, and by setting default 
        parameter values that work in most cases. The goal is to allow users to 
        quickly publish large tables with one function call without having to 
        write detailed code to configure the tables.
