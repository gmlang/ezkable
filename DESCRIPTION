Description: It's difficult to show a large (long or wide) table properly in a 
pdf document produced by R markdown. This package solves that problem by 
combining functions from the `kableExtra` package with `knitr::kable()` and 
setting default parameter values that work in most cases. The goal is to allow 
users to quickly publish large tables with one function call without having to 
write detailed code to configure the tables.
